## Code of Conduct

Governed by [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report violations privately to the maintainers via the channel in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Ground Rules

- Cross-platform compatibility: Linux, macOS, Windows.
- CI green before review request.
- Open an issue before non-trivial changes.
- One logical change per commit.
- Atomic PRs, preferably one feature per release.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git 2.30 or newer
- A configured signing key for commits (GPG or SSH)
- Project-specific toolchain (documented in the README once the stack is finalised)

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZacKienzle2/ProtocolPolicyLab.git
cd ProtocolPolicyLab
git config commit.gpgsign true
```

Install dependencies. Run the test suite.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before submitting:

- Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ZacKienzle2/ProtocolPolicyLab/issues) for duplicates.
- Reproduce against the latest `main`.
- Collect reproduction info.

Use the bug report template. Include:

- Descriptive title.
- Exact reproduction steps.
- Observed vs expected behaviour.
- Screenshots, logs, sample inputs where relevant.
- Environment: OS, runtime version, project version or commit SHA.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Use the feature request template. Include:

- Descriptive title.
- Detailed description of the proposed enhancement.
- Motivation and use case.
- Alternatives considered.

### Your First Code Contribution

Issues tagged:

- `good first issue` - small scope, requires a few lines plus a test.
- `help wanted` - larger scope than `good first issue`.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork, branch from `main`.
2. Code changes ship with tests.
3. API changes ship with documentation.
4. Test suite passes.
5. Lints pass.
6. Commits signed and DCO signed off.
7. Open PR, fill in the template.

## Development Workflow

1. Sync your fork with upstream `main`.
2. Create a feature branch with a semantic name.
3. Implement the change in small, atomic commits.
4. Rebase against `main` to resolve conflicts.
5. Open a pull request once CI is green locally.
6. Address review feedback with fixup commits, then squash before merge.

## Branching Strategy

- `main` - always deployable, protected, requires green CI and peer review.
- `feat/<ticket-id-or-slug>` - new features.
- `fix/<ticket-id-or-slug>` - bug fixes.
- `perf/<slug>` - performance improvements.
- `refactor/<slug>` - non-behavioural refactors.
- `docs/<slug>` - documentation only.
- `test/<slug>` - test additions or fixes.
- `chore/<slug>` - tooling, dependencies, housekeeping.

Never force-push to `main` or any shared branch.

## Commit Message Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). ASCII only. No emoji, smart quotes, or em dashes.

Format:

```text
<type>[(scope)][!]: <description>

[body]

[footer(s)]
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `revert`.

Rules:

- Subject: imperative, lowercase, no trailing period, 72 characters or fewer.
- Blank line between subject, body, and footers.
- Body: wrap at 72 characters. Explain motivation and contrast with prior behaviour. Do not restate the diff.
- One logical change per commit. `fix` only for real defects.
- Breaking changes: append `!` after the type or include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

Example:

```text
feat(parser): support nested arrays

Extends the tokenizer to recognise bracket depth so deeply nested
literals parse without backtracking.

Refs #142
```

## Coding Standards

- Match the style of the surrounding code.
- Run formatters and linters before committing.
- Self-evident code. Avoid inline comments. Document public APIs with the project's chosen docstring style.
- Production-ready code on the first pass. No commented-out blocks, no debug prints, no TODOs without a referenced issue.
- ASCII only in committed text, code, and commit messages.

## Testing

- Every behavioural change ships with tests.
- Bug fixes include a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after.
- Keep tests deterministic. Avoid sleeps, network calls, and clock dependencies in unit tests.
- Mirror the source tree in the test tree.

## Documentation

- Update the README and any affected docs in the same commit as the code change.
- Document public APIs.
- Document breaking changes in the changelog and the PR description.

## Code Review

Reviewers check:

- Correctness, including edge cases and error handling.
- Test coverage of new behaviour and regressions.
- API design, naming, and backward compatibility.
- Performance implications in hot paths.
- Security implications, including input validation and secret handling.
- Documentation parity with the code change.

Authors:

- Respond to every comment, either with a change or with reasoning.
- Resolve conversations only after the reviewer is satisfied.
- Re-request review after addressing feedback.

## Release Process

1. Update the changelog.
2. Bump the version using SemVer based on the commit history.
3. Tag the release commit with `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
4. Publish the release notes from the changelog.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All commits signed off under [DCO 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/):

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(scope): description"
```

Appends:
